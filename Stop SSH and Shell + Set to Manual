#If you want to only run this on the hosts in a cluster instead, change Get-Datacenter to Get-Cluster. If you want to just run on
#a single host then delete Get-Datacenter "DC Name" |  then add the host name after Get-vmhost.
#Comment out which ever commands you dont want to run if you're trying to run this as actual script instead of just using the oneliner
#in powercli.
